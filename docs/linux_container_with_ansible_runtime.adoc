. <<Building Container File with ansible-build>>
. <<Run container (choose one style)>>
.. <<Run using Ansible-Runner>>
.. <<Run in interactive 'Container' Terminal>>

== Starting Point - Linux or Mac with Ansible Installed

ansible-galaxy collection install -r ansible/requirements.yml

== Building Container File with ansible-build
```
# Have ansible installed
# Have ansible-builder installed
pipx install ansible-builder

# Choose if podman or docker container will be used

# Build for podman container - Need podman installed
ansible-builder build --tag live_network_ansible_v1 --container-runtime podman

# Build for Docker container - Need docker installed
ansible-builder build --tag live_network_ansible_v1 --container-runtime docker
```

Alternatively - Prepare Container File but do not create (instantiate) a container yet
```
ansible-builder create
```

== Run container (choose one style)

=== Run using Ansible-Runner
```
ansible-runner run --process-isolation folder -p playbook.yml --container-image localhost/image_name
```

=== Run in interactive 'Container' Terminal
```
# Start container
ansible-runner run --process-isolation folder -p playbook.yml --container-image localhost/image_name

# Start container, with shared folder/storage
# Copy ansible playbooks into that storage
# Launch container terminal
# Navigate to playbook folder, and run ansible commands
```
